# Assignment-Laravel
To install Laravel, these are the general steps:

Requirements:

1.Made sure I have PHP installed on my system. Laravel requires PHP 7.4 or higher.
Ensured that have Composer installed, as it is the dependency manager for Laravel.

2. Installing Laravel:

Opened a terminal or command prompt.
Navigated to the directory where I want to install Laravel.

To Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name

Replaced "project-name" with the desired name, here i used "Assignment-app".

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel Assignment-app

3.Generate Application Key:

In the terminal, navigated to my Laravel project's root directory.
Run the following command to generate a unique application key:

php artisan key:generate


4.Run the Development Server:

In the terminal, navigated to my Laravel project's root directory.
Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:

php artisan serve

By default, the server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

5. Verify Installation:

Opened a web browser and visited http://127.0.0.1:8000/(or the specified URL if you changed it).
I saw the Laravel welcome page, it means Laravel is successfully installed.

Created a new route in Laravel project that displays a simple "Hello, World!" message. Take a screenshot of the running route.

Here is the Laravel project running screenshot:

These steps outline a basic installation of Laravel. Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to configure additional settings, install additional packages, or set up a database. The Laravel documentation provides detailed information on these topics, and it is recommended to consult the documentation for further customization and configuration.

Laravel Folder Structure:----
In a Laravel project, the purpose of each of the following folders is as follows:

app: The "app" folder contains the core of your application. It includes the models, controllers, and other PHP classes that define the business logic of your application.

bootstrap: The "bootstrap" folder contains the files responsible for bootstrapping the Laravel framework. It includes the configuration files and the application's entry point.

config: The "config" folder holds all the configuration files for your Laravel application. It includes files for database connections, application settings, service providers, and more. You can modify these files to customize the behavior of your application.

database: The "database" folder contains the database-related files. It includes migrations (files that define database schema changes), seeders (files that populate the database with sample data), and factories (files that define the structure of your database records for testing).

public: The "public" folder is the web root of your application. It contains the index.php file, which serves as the entry point for all HTTP requests. It also includes the assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, that are publicly accessible.

resources: The "resources" folder contains the non-PHP resources used by your application, such as views (HTML templates), language files, and assets like CSS and JavaScript. These resources are typically compiled and optimized for production.

routes: The "routes" folder contains the route definitions for your application. Routes define the URLs that the application responds to and specify the corresponding controller methods or closures that handle the requests.

storage: The "storage" folder contains files generated by your application. It includes logs, cached views, session files, and other temporary or persistent files that the application needs to store.

tests: The "tests" folder contains the automated tests for your application. It includes unit tests, feature tests, and any other tests you write to ensure your code works as expected.

vendor: The "vendor" folder is created by Composer, the PHP dependency manager used by Laravel. It contains all the third-party libraries and packages that your application depends on. This folder is typically not modified directly but rather managed through Composer's configuration file (composer.json) and commands.
